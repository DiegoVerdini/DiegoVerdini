So i discovered what physics was really about at 13, in middle school, where we learnt cinematics and dynamics (only theoretical, no formulas, no maths, just what they were about) and i loved it. I started reading books about relativity, astrophysics and quantum physics, until 14 i wanted to be a astrophysicist. At 14 i said to myself what do i do with relativity and stuff only theoretically if i can’t use formulas (i knew almost no formulas at that time, but i understood how things work) so i spent all the summer doing the 5 year high school programme in only 3 months, and i menaged to do it, so i started preparing myself for physics olimpics. 2 Days ago i had my first preparation with a teacher in my school( until then i learnt all by myself) and i was at the same level with the ones from 5 years above me. I actually discovered i trained with the past papers of the second test, not the first, wich was much harder. in 20 days i have the first test and i think to make some videos explaining how to resolve problems.

During the time i studyed dynamics, mechanics cinematics and thermodynamics i saw my potential on it, I understood everything so quickly, I stared getting very interested in engenering so i united my passion for space and planes with engeniring and my passion for aereospace was born. From this moment my dream was to beccome an aeresopace engeneer, but not like the others, i wanted to invent things, to lead a “squad of engeneers”, i wanted to be reconized.

I started building my first rc plane (i’m still doing tests, i don’t want it to crash yk) and learning everything i could to reach my dream, First physics, then robotics and c++ with arduino ide, then python and i’m thinking about learning CAD
This profile has ONLY MY PERSONAL PROJECTS SINCE i was 15/16
These are my most difficult and important projects
